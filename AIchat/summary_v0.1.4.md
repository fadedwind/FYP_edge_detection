# Release v0.1.4

Release summary for v0.1.4 — generated by assistant.

## Overview
- Make GUI detection-only: removed classification paths and simplified the UI to draw detection boxes on the image and report counts via popup and terminal output.
- Fixed inconsistencies between ultralytics detection outputs and GUI parsing: detection parsing in `image_recognition.py` was made more robust to different ultralytics API shapes (support for `names`, per-box attributes, and tensor outputs).
- Removed complex right-side structured results panel from `cat_recognition_gui.py` per user request; now the GUI only shows image with bounding boxes and a simple popup summary.
- Added `docs/CAT_INSTALL.md` with instructions to run the GUI using a local `yolov8n.pt` weight file.
- Updated `.gitignore` to ignore the `models/` directory so large weights are not accidentally committed.
- Updated `requirements.txt` to include `ultralytics` and `timm` and clarified `torch` installation notes.

## Files changed / added
- Modified: `cat_recognition_gui.py` — detection-only UI and more robust loading of local `models/yolov8n.pt`.
- Modified: `image_recognition.py` — improved detection parsing and compatibility with different ultralytics outputs.
- Added: `docs/CAT_INSTALL.md` — run/install instructions and notes.
- Added: `AIchat/summary_v0.1.4.md` — this release summary.
- Updated: `.gitignore` — added `models/`.
- Updated: `requirements.txt` — add `ultralytics`, `timm` and notes about `torch`.

## Notes & next steps
- If `models/yolov8n.pt` was previously committed to the repository history, consider removing it from git history (BFG or git filter-repo) to reduce repo size. `.gitignore` alone will not remove previously committed large files.
- If you want a small in-GUI textual result panel again (e.g. a list of detections), I can add a lightweight Listbox instead of the previous Treeview/console combo.
- If you need classification functionality reintroduced, we'll need classifier weights or a training plan; I can prepare a training script or recommend options.
